# [80. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array II](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-array-ii/)

## 题目
Follow up for "Remove Duplicates":
What if duplicates are allowed at most twice?


For example,
Given sorted array nums = `[1,1,1,2,2,3]`,


Your function should return length = `5`, with the first five elements of nums being `1`, `1`, `2`, `2` and `3`. It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the new length.
